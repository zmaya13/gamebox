Playtime: watch a launched game, and record how long it ran.

GameBox did no process tracking at all. The only "last played" it had was the
date Steam wrote into its own appmanifest, so a GOG game, an Epic game, a ROM
or a folder game had none - and "Never played" meant "not a Steam game" as
often as it meant never played.

Watching is harder than it sounds, because for most of the library there is no
child process to wait on. Launching a Steam game means firing a steam:// URI,
which returns immediately; the game is started minutes later by a Steam process
that is not ours. So instead of following a process, this follows a *folder*:
any process running from inside the game's install directory is that game.
That is the approach Playnite takes, and it works for every kind of game here.

  track(gid, folder, pid=None, on_finish=...)   start watching
  playing()                                     what is running right now
  stop(gid)                                     forget one game

Pure ctypes against psapi, so this adds no dependency.
