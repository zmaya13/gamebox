GameBox - a unified game library for Windows.

A frameless native window: the title bar is part of the app, not a Windows
box bolted on top. One process - closing the window ends everything, and
there is no background service and no network port.

  python gamebox.py            run from source
  GameBox.exe                  the built application
  GameBox.exe --selftest       check a build can do what only a build gets wrong
  GameBox.exe --uitest         open the window and confirm it drew the library

Everything that touches the machine - launching a game, opening a folder,
scanning drives - is a Python call over the pywebview bridge.
