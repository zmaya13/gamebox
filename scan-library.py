GameBox library scanner
=======================

Finds the games installed on this PC, resolves cover art and store metadata,
and writes the result straight into the app.

  python scan-library.py                     scan and print a report
  python scan-library.py --json library.json write the raw scan out as JSON
  python scan-library.py --apply             merge the scan into library.json
  python scan-library.py --root C:\\ --root D:\\Games

What it reads
-------------
  Steam       <drive>\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\appmanifest_*.acf
              real title, appid, size on disk, last played, last updated
  GOG         %ProgramData%\\GOG.com\\Galaxy\\storage\\galaxy-2.0.db
              owned and installed releases, plus each game's cover hashes
  Epic        %ProgramData%\\Epic\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Data\\Manifests\\*.item
              display name, app id and launch executable
  Xbox        <drive>\\XboxGames\\*\\Content\\MicrosoftGame.config
  Ubisoft     HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Ubisoft\\Launcher\\Installs
  EA          HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Electronic Arts, plus each install's installerdata.xml
  Battle.net  each install's .build.info, and the uninstall entries
  Amazon      %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Amazon Games\\...\\GameInstallInfo.sqlite
  itch.io     %APPDATA%\\itch\\db\\butler.db
  Folders     one game per top-level folder under each --root
  ROMs        any file a known emulator can open, and PlayStation 3 game
              folders, which are directories rather than disc images

Emulators
---------
  92 emulators and 561 profiles, from Playnite's definitions in emulation/
  (MIT - see emulation/NOTICE). A profile says which platforms it covers, which
  extensions it accepts, how to recognise its executable, and the command line
  to start a game with - so a game is launched the way its emulator expects
  rather than with a bare path and no arguments.

  Where a file cannot say which console it is for - a .iso is a PS2 disc or a
  PS3 disc - the folder it sits in decides, and the app can override that per
  game.

Cover art, in priority order
----------------------------
  1. Steam's own cache      %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Steam\\appcache\\librarycache
  2. GOG Galaxy's webcache  %ProgramData%\\GOG.com\\Galaxy\\webcache
  3. Steam's public CDN     matched by title through Steam's app search
  4. Generated              a platform plate for disc images and ROMs

With --apply it merges the scan into the library:
  library.json     the library the app reads, keyed by a derived id so that a
                   rescan refreshes a game rather than replacing it - anything
                   you have done to a game (favourite, tags, notes, playtime)
                   is left alone
  art/             covers, heroes and screenshots, as files
  library-backups/ a timestamped copy taken before every merge

A game the scan no longer finds is marked not installed rather than deleted,
so uninstalling a game does not throw away what you recorded about it.

It only ever reads your games. It never moves, deletes or modifies them.
