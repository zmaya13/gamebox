GameBox library store
=====================

The library used to be a `const G=[...]` array spliced into GameBox.html by a
regex, keyed by scan-order integers. That meant three things, all bad:

  * a rescan renumbered every game, so the favourites and hidden lists in
    localStorage silently re-pointed at *different* games;
  * a rescan overwrote the file, so there was nowhere to keep anything the user
    had done - a tag, a note, a playtime;
  * every cover rode along as a base64 data: URI, so the page was 3.7 MB and
    could still be parsing when the bridge announced itself.

So the library now lives in library.json next to the exe, keyed by a *derived*
id that survives a rescan, and the page is just code again.

  library.json     {"version": 2, "scanned": "...", "games": [...]}
  art/<id>.jpg     covers, heroes and screenshots, as files
  library-backups/ a timestamped copy taken before every merge

A game record splits into three parts, and the split is the whole point:

  scanner-owned   title, store, path, bytes, installed, launch, art, meta, files
                  - refreshed on every scan
  "user"          favorite, hidden, tags, categories, completion, score, notes,
                  and title/cover overrides - the scanner never touches these
  "play"          seconds, count, last, sessions - written by the play tracker
